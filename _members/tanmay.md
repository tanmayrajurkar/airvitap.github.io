# Hi! I am **Tanmay**

I am a Computer Science undergraduate at VIT AP University with a strong interest in building **data-driven, real-world systems**. My work spans across **AI, data engineering, and full-stack development**, with a focus on solving large-scale problems in public infrastructure and platform products.

I have hands-on experience designing and implementing end-to-end systems that ingest, process, and analyze real-world data. I enjoy working on problems that involve ambiguity, scale, and impact rather than purely academic or toy projects.

Some of the domains I actively work in include:

- **Artificial Intelligence**
- **Data Engineering & Analytics**
- **Public Infrastructure & Civic Technology**

I have built and led projects such as **SAGAR**, an AI-driven marine and geospatial intelligence platform for public infrastructure and research stakeholders, and **PARAS**, an AI-powered smart parking system that improves urban mobility through predictive analytics. Both projects were recognized at the national level through the Smart India Hackathon.

Beyond projects, I have also worked in product and strategy roles, collaborating with founders and cross-functional teams to translate user and business needs into shipped solutions.

#### Let's Build Something Meaningful

I am always interested in collaborating on impactful projects, open-source contributions, and systems that operate at real-world scale. If you’re working on something challenging and meaningful, feel free to reach out.
